# Who Am I?
- I've hitch-hiked across most of the Indian subcontinent as a teen, in what was to be a coming of age (w)rite of passage
- Spent the best years of my youth getting a (high)er education at the School of Hard Knocks, graduating with honors
- Surrounded myself with animals; cats, dogs, squirrels, birds. I'm happier in the animal kingdom than the human fiefdom
- Retired, yet combative and cognitive in capability, I sometimes teach fighting and philosophy to the young and curious

## Why I write
I write for my personal catharsis, but eventually, it percolates into something I share. I explore the underbelly of my life, the subconscious of my mind, to entertain and enlighten. To share that momentary drop of satori in the vast ocean of infinite experience.
## What I Write
I promise to share my thoughts every week on subjects ranging from the physical to the spiritual, from fighting to philosophy, from sanity to insanity. Are you not entertained? If you are curious, [subscribe](https://reddy2go.substack.com/). You'll find me writing about these topics in a reality bending, gonzo-esque fashion.
## Movement
I want to help you discover the magic of the body. To make the most of your physicality. Learn to enjoy your body  beyond patterned fitness regimes.
## Madness
I want to help you understand and enjoy your ’madness’ without feeling guilt or shame. Celebrate your eccentricities & aberrations instead of conforming to the norm.
## Mortality
I want to help you prepare for death, to celebrate the end of our journey with grace and satisfaction. Embrace and celebrate the fact that you too will die.
